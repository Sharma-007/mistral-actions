## OpenStack Mistal Actions

Mistral is the OpenStack workflow service. This project aims to provide a mechanism to define tasks and workflows without writing code, manage and execute them in the cloud environment.

Mistral allow user write a new custom action, but must reinstall Mistral if it was installed in system(ref: https://docs.openstack.org/developer/mistral/developer/creating_custom_action.html), it's hardly acceptable for production environment. This project aims to provide a simple tool to auto-discover new actions, and register it without effecting environment. This project also collect some extra useful actions which don't exist in standard action list.

### How to run ?

For the impatient:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/int32bit/mistral-actions.git
cd mistral-actions
python setup.py install
python register_actions.py --config-file /etc/mistral/mistral.conf
systemctl restart openstack-mistral-engine openstack-mistral-executor
```

#### 1. Clone this project to your mistral api node

```sh
git clone https://github.com/int32bit/mistral-actions.git
cd mistral-actions
```

#### 2. Install

```sh
sudo python setup.py install
```

#### 3. Register actions

```sh
python register_actions.py --config-file /etc/mistral/mistral.conf
```

#### 4. Restart mistral services

```sh
systemctl restart openstack-mistral-engine openstack-mistral-executor
```

#### 5. Run action

Once you succeed to register actions, you can use it in your workflow or directly run in place:

```sh
mistral run-action mistral_actions.nova.servers.ServerAssertStatus '{"server":"ef7ee146-1c27-448f-b948-d8821c59ec51"}'
```

### Action Catalog

| name | input | description |
|----|----|----|
| systems.ExecAction | cmd  |Run command with arguments and return its output as a byte string. Note you can use at most one pipe, like 'ls -l | wc -l'.|
| nova.servers.ServerAssertStatus|server, status='ACTIVE'|Assert a server in special status.|
|...|...|...|


### How to write new action ?

Write a class inherited from mistral.actions.base.Action in `mistral_actions` directory:

```python
from mistral.actions import base

class RunnerAction(base.Action):
    
    def __init__(self, param):
        # store the incoming params
        self.param = param

    def run(self):
        # return your results here
        return {'status': 0}
```

You just need add a `__export__` attribute to tell us to publish the class, and you don't need change `setup.cfg`.

You can use `format_code.sh` script to format your code to pep8 style. It's better to run `tox -e pep8` to ensure your code in pep8 style.

```
./format_code.sh
tox -e pep8
```

Register your actions and restart mistral services:

```
python setup.py install
python register_actions.py --config-file /etc/mistral/mistral.conf
systemctl restart openstack-mistral-engine openstack-mistral-executor
```

Now you can call the action example.runner

```yaml
my_workflow:
  tasks:
    my_action_task:
      action: example.runner
      input:
        param: avalue_to_pass_in
```
